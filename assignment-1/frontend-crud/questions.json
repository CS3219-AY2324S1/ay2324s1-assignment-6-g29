      "description": "Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter. Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.",

      "description": "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used: \nI can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.  \nX can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.  \nC can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.",

      "description": "The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, \nF(0) = 0, F(1) = 1\nF(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.\nGiven n, calculate F(n).",
