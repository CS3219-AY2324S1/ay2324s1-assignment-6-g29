      "description": "Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter. Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.",

      "description": "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used: \nI can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.  \nX can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.  \nC can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.",

      "title": "Solving Questions With Brainpower",
      "description": "You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].  The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question i will earn you pointsi points but you will be unable to solve each of the next brainpoweri questions. If you skip question i, you get to make the decision on the next question.  For example, given questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]: If question 0 is solved, you will earn 3 points but you will be unable to solve questions 1 and 2. If instead, question 0 is skipped and question 1 is solved, you will earn 4 points but you will be unable to solve questions 2 and 3. Return the maximum points you can earn for the exam.",
